# all-roads
Idea to become a "all trails" for road trips (name of course to change in due course).

## key features to be included
- must link into google maps to plot routes
- idea to link into all trails to allow for hiking suggestions in locations
- must have "pin-board" for each stop on planned routes, where all activities, restaurant and other reccomendations can be posted
- all road trips can be filtered by country, city/town, state, county, type, distance
